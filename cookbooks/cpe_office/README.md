Description
==================
Installs a profile that suppresses the First Run / Welcome screens for Microsoft Office 2016 on OS X.

Requirements
-----------
Mac OS X

Attributes
----------

Usage
-----
No extra work is required, and no features are customizable.

If Microsoft Outlook 2016 (com.microsoft.Outlook) is installed, this profile will be applied to configure Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote products to suppress first run behavior.

Note that Outlook itself does NOT have this suppressed, as the first run windows are necessary to set up an account for a new user.

The MAU aspects of this cookbook will manage the `com.microsoft.autoupdate2` preference domain. Further info can be found at: https://macadmins.software/docs/MAU_38.pdf
